# stable-coloured-noise
Repo showing implementation for simulating non-gaussian stable processes with some dependency structure.

Use `generators.py` to pull functions for simulating a Gaussian coloured noise (`ffm`), a coloured noise with some input distribution (`iffm`) and a Cauchy coloured noise (`simulate_cauchy_coloured_noise`).
